\section{Ambiguous Business Aliases}
\label{sec:Introduction2}
This thesis is published in the context of a project with the goal to create a graph of Germany's corporate landscape. Businesses represent the graph's nodes and the relationships between businesses represent the edges. Information about businesses is extracted from structured knowledge bases such as Wikidata and DBpedia. They describe the businesses themselves but contain incomplete information about the relationships between them. These relationships are described in unstructured texts like Wikipedia or newspaper articles.\par
For our approach to extract a relationship between two businesses they must first be mentioned in the same sentence. Then both of these mentions need to be found and linked to the entities representing these businesses. Finding these mentions is called \textit{Named Entity Recognition} (NER). They must then be linked to the correct entities in the knowledge base. This step is called \textit{Entity Linking} (EL). The last step is to extract the relationship between the two businesses from the sentence, which is called \textit{Relation Extraction} (RE).\par
Our approach combines NER and EL into a single step and transforms it into a classification problem. Janetzki \cite{janetzki} describes the creation of our knowledge base and the extraction of features used to classify mentions. This work evaluates the quality of the features and different classification models. Schneider \cite{schneider} describes and evaluates different Relation Extraction methods.\par
Section \ref{sec:RelatedWork} covers related work in the field of both NER and EL and especially related work about recognizing and linking business entities and efficient NER and EL on millions of documents in acceptable time. Section \ref{sec:NEL} describes the used approach that combines both NER and EL. After that different classification models and configurations are compared and evaluated in Section \ref{sec:ModelEval}. Section \ref{sec:FeatureEval} evaluates the features used to train the classifier. These features are described in detail by Janetzki \cite{janetzki} and Grütze et al. \cite{coheel}. Section \ref{sec:NELEval} discusses the performance and quality of this approach when annotating millions of newspaper articles. Finally, Section \ref{sec:Conclusion} concludes this thesis and describes possible improvements that could be done in the future.
